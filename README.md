🚗 Automobile Mileage Prediction

  

🚀 Overview

Predicting the mileage of an automobile is crucial for optimizing fuel efficiency, reducing costs, and making informed decisions about vehicle performance. This project leverages machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that estimates the Miles Per Gallon (MPG) based on various automobile features.

✨ Features

✅ Accurate Mileage Prediction using ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

✅ Feature Engineering to enhance model performance

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insightful data visualization

✅ Hyperparameter Tuning for optimizing model performance

✅ Deployment Ready using Flask or FastAPI (Optional)

✅ Interactive Dashboard (Using Streamlit or Dash) for user-friendly predictions
